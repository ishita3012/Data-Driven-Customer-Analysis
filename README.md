### This project analyzes a marketing campaign dataset to uncover customer insights and predict revenue outcomes. 

#### The workflow begins with data exploration: 
Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and generating descriptive statistics to understand customer demographics and behaviors. Using tools like **_groupby_**, **_pivot_table_**, and **_crosstab_**, the analysis highlights trends such as average income by education, spending habits by marital status, and patterns in family structure.


Visualizations including ***histograms***, ***boxplots***, and a ***correlation heatmap*** are used to identify key variables that influence revenue, with strong associations found between _product categories_ and _total spend_. A linear regression model is then built to evaluate which factors significantly impact revenue, followed by a simplified model using only the most relevant variables. Finally, a **predictive model** is created using **train-test splits** and evaluated using metrics like **RMSE and RÂ²** to ensure generalization.

_It combines statistical reasoning, product thinking, and data science techniques to generate actionable business insights and improve campaign targeting strategies._
