This project analyzes a marketing campaign dataset to uncover customer insights and predict revenue outcomes. The workflow begins with data exploration: cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and generating descriptive statistics to understand customer demographics and behaviors. Using tools like groupby, pivot_table, and crosstab, the analysis highlights trends such as average income by education, spending habits by marital status, and patterns in family structure.
Visualizations including histograms, boxplots, and a correlation heatmap are used to identify key variables that influence revenue, with strong associations found between product categories and total spend. A linear regression model is then built to evaluate which factors significantly impact revenue, followed by a simplified model using only the most relevant variables. Finally, a predictive model is created using train-test splits and evaluated using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² to ensure generalization.
The project combines statistical reasoning, product thinking, and data science techniques to generate actionable business insights and improve campaign targeting strategies.
